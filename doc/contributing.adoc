Contributing
============

This document is here mainly to make the job of those who review merge requests
easier and is more of a guideline rather than a strict set of rules. However,
please try to follow them as much as you can.

Getting the most recent source
------------------------------
Commits need to be submitted in Git format and are best if they are against the
latest version of the code. There are several helpful tutorials for getting
started with Git if you have not worked with it before.

* https://git-scm.com/book
* https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html

The pacman-contrib code can be fetched using the following command:

	git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman-contrib.git

Creating your commits
---------------------

--
* Use `git commit -s` for creating a commit of your changes.

The -s allows you to credit yourself by adding a "Signed Off By" line to
indicate who has "signed" the patch - who has approved it.

	Signed-off-by: Aaron Griffin <aaron@archlinux.org>

Please use your real name and email address. Feel free to "scramble" the
address if you're afraid of spam.

* Describe your commits.

It helps if you describe the overview and goals in the Git commit log. This
allows others to see what you intended so as to compare it to what was actually
done, and allows better feedback.

Creating a merge request
------------------------
See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html.

--
* Don't get discouraged

Any feedback you get, positive or negative, has nothing to do with you. If
changes are requested, try taking the suggestions into account and update the
merge request. We welcome most submissions here, and some may take a bit longer
to get looked over than others.

* Respond to feedback

When you do get feedback, it usually merits a response, whether this be a
submission of commits with corrections or a follow-up comment asking
for clarifications.
